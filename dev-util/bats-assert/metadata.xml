		bats-assert is a helper library providing common assertions for bats-core.

		Assertions are functions that perform a test and output relevant information on failure to 
		help debugging. They return 1 on failure and 0 otherwise. Output, formatted for readability,
		is sent to the standard error to make assertions usable outside of @test blocks too.

		Assertions testing exit code and output operate on the results of the most recent invocation
		of run.
