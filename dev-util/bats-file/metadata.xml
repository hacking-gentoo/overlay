		bats-file is a helper library providing common filesystem related assertions and helpers for bats-core.

		Assertions are functions that perform a test and output relevant information on failure to help debugging. 
		They return 1 on failure and 0 otherwise. Output, formatted for readability, is sent to the standard error
		to make assertions usable outside of @test blocks too.

		Features:

		    assertions
		    temporary directory handling
